Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard project based on my personal Spotify streaming history. This interactive report dives deep into my listening behavior, highlighting trends across artists, albums, and track preferences over the years.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Spotify provides users with access to their historical listening data. I exported my personal streaming history and transformed it into a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to uncover insights around how, when, and what I listen to most frequently.

This project is not just about data visualization—it's about storytelling with data and learning how to apply data analytics tools to real-world, personal datasets.
